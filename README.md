# crime-record-management-system
A centralized Crime Record Management System for the police as well as the common people. It has a portal where people can file their FIRs from a police station. The police has a centralized view of these complaints and can monitor them from anywhere. Information such as the officer for the case, description of the case, list of accused, etc. is also available in the portal. This system helps eliminate the ledger system which is currently used.
